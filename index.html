                <p>The city is one of the most unique in the world, with so much to do and so much history behind it. You’re across the river from MIT, down the street from BC, and a drive away from Harvard. Boston Common is beautiful nearly year round, and the financial district is really fun to just chill and walk around in. Tons of amazing restaurants and shopping around Newbury street and Downtown Boston as well. Courses - the most obvious of them all, but BU is of high ranking in every school. Communications, Questrom, Sargent, and more are all amazing and the classes and professors are high quality .Not only are Boston restaurants top quality, but the dining halls are actually really good compared to other schools. The staff is amazing and while the food isn’t 5 stars, it’s the best you’ll get so far as college dining goes.</p>

                <p>Boston University is a rigorous institution and its academic environment pushes and challenges its students to become well rounded and high achieving people. The community is quite large, yet surprisingly simultaneously small enough to be able to meet a lot of people and have mutual friends. Most of the professors I've had have been wonderful and very accommodating. The academics, as I mentioned before, are very rigorous and it is definitely necessary to put in a lot of time to complete quality work. The campus is accessible and beautiful, and it is very close to downtown Boston, making it very easy to get more into the city. The dining halls vary-- some are better than others-- and so does the food. The on-campus living is also quite accommodating and accessible, but it is sometimes hard to advance to other housing arrangement as you become an upperclassman. Overall, however, I've had a wonderful time at BU and really enjoy being a student here!</p>
